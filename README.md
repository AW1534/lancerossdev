## Hey there! I'm Lance Ross ðŸ‘‹
I am an aspiring Front-end JavaScript web developer in the Philippines building different Web applications for fun. I'm currently learning [Angular](https://angular.io) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) which are my favorite tools for Web development by Google. I enjoy building projects using good ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also use many front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and Angular.

When not busy with doing web development stuff, I play different video games, plays guitar, and does exercises.
