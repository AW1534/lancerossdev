## Hey there! I'm Lance Ross ðŸ‘‹
I am an aspiring Front-end JavaScript web developer in the Philippines building different Web applications for fun. I'm currently learning [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) which are my favorite tools. I enjoy building projects using good ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will also use front-end frameworks like React and Svelte which I'm going to learn soon.

When not busy with doing web development stuff, I play different video games, try to how to play a guitar, and does exercises every other day.
