## Hey there! I'm Lance Ross ðŸ‘‹
I am an aspiring CSS and JavaScript front-end web developer. I just started a few months ago learning web development because I really enjoy it and that's why I picked it as my hobby for now.

I'm currently mastering CSS and JavaScript for basic front-end UI. The reason I prefer learning CSS and JavaScript first before learning frameworks like Bootstrap or Angular is because I want to focus first on what I want to learn and not jumping already to another topic/language and forget how to do it. I picked front-end than back-end or full stack because I want to be creative and artistic with designs.
