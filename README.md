## Hi, I'm Lance Ross 👋
I am an aspiring front-end web developer. I started just a few months learning web development because I really enjoy it (except when dealing with CSS properties lol).

I'm currently learning [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for front-end UI. I picked front-end than back-end because I want to be creative and artistic with designs. I also have skills on CSS, SaSS (SCSS) and JavaScript.
